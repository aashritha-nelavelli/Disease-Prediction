## Project Overview
This project focuses on the prediction of diseases by analyzing facial features. Using advanced deep learning algorithms, the system identifies potential health issues based on facial patterns, allowing for a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Such an approach has potential applications in telemedicine, preventive health monitoring, and accessible healthcare diagnostics.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images with various facial features that are indicative of different health conditions. The dataset includes:
- **Training Data**: Images with known health labels for training the model.
- **Testing Data**: Images for evaluating model performance.

**Note**: As per privacy concerns, I have used images sourced from Google.

## Model Architecture
We employ a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to process facial images and predict potential diseases. Key aspects of the model include:
- **Feature Extraction**: Using CNN layers to capture intricate patterns in facial features.
- **Classification**: Predicting the likelihood of specific diseases based on extracted features.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model effectiveness.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naidu-2002/Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Disease-Prediction

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash

   Output images with prediction results will be diaplayed.

## Results
The model successfully predicted the following diseases based on facial features:
- **Beta Thalassemia**
- **Hyperthyroidism**
- **Down Syndrome**
- **Leprosy**

These predictions were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, with initial results indicating promising accuracy in identifying disease-specific facial patterns.

## Future Work
